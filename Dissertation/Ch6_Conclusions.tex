\section{Conclusions and Discussion}
\label{sec:conclusions}

% TODO (~1500 words)

\subsection{Objectives Revisited}
\label{sec:conc-objectives}

% For each PDD objective, state: met / partially met / not met, with evidence.
%
% 1. End-to-end auction flow (list -> bid -> MPC -> winner -> decrypt)
%    - Status: [achieved / partially achieved]
%    - Evidence: integration tests, e2e demo
%
% 2. Sealed-bid via MPC (Shamir, N >= 3)
%    - Status: [achieved]
%    - Evidence: auction_n.mpc, mock-based tests for 3/5/10 parties
%
% 3. MPC-gated content decryption
%    - Status: [achieved via commitment + challenge-response]
%    - Note: PDD mentioned 1-out-of-N OT — descoped to simpler scheme. Discuss why.
%
% 4. Monero testnet settlement
%    - Status: [not implemented]
%    - Discuss scope reduction: complexity of Monero RPC integration,
%      time constraints, not essential for demonstrating core MPC+Veilid contribution.

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:conc-discussion}

% - Main contribution: demonstrated that Veilid + MPC can provide a working
%   sealed-bid auction without a trusted auctioneer
% - Security analysis reveals fundamental tradeoffs (seller trust, small-N threshold)
% - Compare to prior work: Danish sugar beet auction had a trusted cooperative;
%   this project removes that but introduces seller-as-party-0 trust assumption
% - Link conclusions back to Context chapter

\subsection{Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues}
\label{sec:conc-lsepi}

% MANDATORY section (handbook 8.2.7). Marks deducted if missing.
%
% - Dual-use risk: private marketplace could facilitate illicit trade
%   - Mitigation: devnet only, no mainnet, testnet funds only, no deployment scripts for public
% - Privacy vs accountability tradeoff
%   - Sealed bids protect bidders but complicate dispute resolution
% - Licensing compliance:
%   - Veilid: MPL-2.0 (file-level copyleft, complied with)
%   - MP-SPDZ: BSD-3-Clause (permissive)
%   - All other deps: MIT/Apache-2.0
% - BCS Code of Conduct: no work that endangers individuals
% - Data protection: no PII collected, no human participants
% - Revisit PDD LSEPI section — what changed during the project?

\subsection{Future Work}
\label{sec:conc-future}

% - Threshold decryption: remove seller trust assumption (key shared among MPC parties)
% - Dishonest-majority protocol (SPDZ) for small auctions
% - Monero testnet integration for settlement
% - Mobile client (Veilid supports mobile platforms)
% - Formal protocol verification (ProVerif / Tamarin)
% - Anti-replay nonces on message types
% - Rate limiting / DoS protection

\subsection{Reflections}
\label{sec:conc-reflections}

% - What was learned (Veilid, MPC, Rust async, P2P development)
% - Challenges faced (Veilid API stability, MPC sidecar complexity, devnet setup)
% - What would be done differently (start MPC integration earlier, simpler UI)
% - Project management: how plan deviated from PDD timeline
