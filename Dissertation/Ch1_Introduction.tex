\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% TODO (~1000 words total for this chapter)

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:intro-problem}

% - Popular marketplaces (eBay, FB Marketplace) either leak bid info or have no formal auction
% - Blockchain auctions add auditability but invite front-running / MEV
% - Sealed-bid auctions preserve privacy but require a trusted auctioneer
% - MPC removes the trusted auctioneer, but needs a coordination and transport layer

\subsection{Project Objectives}
\label{sec:intro-objectives}

% Main objective: deliver a working P2P marketplace on Veilid supporting
% sealed-bid listings with MPC-based winner determination.
%
% Sub-objectives:
%   1. End-to-end auction flow (list -> bid -> MPC -> winner -> decrypt)
%   2. Sealed-bid via Shamir secret sharing (N >= 3 parties)
%   3. MPC-gated content decryption (commitment + challenge-response)
%   4. Monero testnet settlement (status: not implemented — discuss scope change)

\subsection{Beneficiaries}
\label{sec:intro-beneficiaries}

% - Project consultant (proof-of-concept for Veilid)
% - Veilid community (real-world application demonstrating capabilities)
% - Privacy-oriented marketplace users (research prototype)

\subsection{Scope and Assumptions}
\label{sec:intro-scope}

% - Proof-of-concept, not production deployment
% - Devnet only (no public Veilid network, no mainnet funds)
% - Honest-majority assumption for Shamir (N/2+1 honest parties)
% - Seller trust assumption for decryption key release
% - Monero integration planned but descoped (discuss why)

\subsection{Report Structure}
\label{sec:intro-structure}

% Brief roadmap: Ch 2 outputs, Ch 3 context, Ch 4 method, Ch 5 results, Ch 6 conclusions
