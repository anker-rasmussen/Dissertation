Project title: Application Development Using the Veilid Application
               Framework
--------------------------------------------------------------------


+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------+
| Project description: | **Keywords:** networking, privacy, anonymity,   |
|                      | peer-to-peer, distributed applications,         |
|                      | anti-surveillance, cryptography                 |
|                      |                                                 |
|                      | **Description:** The Veilid framework (         |
|                      | https://veilid.com/ ) is a recent developed     |
|                      | collection of protocols to build distributed,   |
|                      | private applications. It builds on the onion    |
|                      | routing ideas used by Tor and I2P as well as    |
|                      | distributed hash tables and routing as used     |
|                      | in IPFS and others. It aims to make             |
|                      | developing highly-scalable, distributed,        |
|                      | private applications easy. Veilid is still      |
|                      | very much under active development, so this     |
|                      | project would aim to create a                   |
|                      | proof-of-concept / example application to       |
|                      | demonstrate some of its features. Possible      |
|                      | applications:                                   |

|                      | - A multi-user notepad / text editor.           |
|                      |                                                 |
|                      | - An anonymous voting system.                   |
|                      |                                                 |
|                      | - An anonymous question submission system.      |
|                      |                                                 |
|                      | - A SOCKS proxy                                 |
|                      |                                                 |
