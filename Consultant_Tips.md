## What not to do
Not detailed enough PDD
Haven't thought through title, lack of preparation, lack of detail, attention to detail etc.
Lack of progression within the PDD.

## Things to do
Be specific with things! Esp data collection from humans!
Consider ethical considerations for data processing + preparation for handling sensitive data (potentially!)
Use a proper timeline for expected/realistic way to complete project
Make project plan realistic (plan around exams, try to follow the goals.)
Start writeup early.
Write up as the project is being done — don't leave it all for the last week
When you've read the content — literature review/critical context
Method section can be written as I go.

Start high level, break it into smaler pieces, define all terms, define various protocols and technologies. If assuming competence, provide a link so readers can do additional reading. 
Write bullets for each piece of obscure terminology and then write a paragraph/few sentences for each. 

After the first draft is done, write further edits. 

No requirements to have human participants. 

Automate testing

Scope out who is impacted, how it affects them, what probability of it affecting them?
Risk matrix/management. Mitigate risk (not the same as removing risk)

Responsible & Ethical Disclosure

Have backups!

Automate, automate, automate!

Qs: 
Can I use IEEE instead of harvard citations? - Yes
Do I need to have citations within my project plan - looks like yes?

Do I need to use all of my papers that I have in my bibliography/reference file? Flexible
Can I use more references not from within my PDD in the full report? Flexible


Can I walk back human participants for data collection? Yes - but plan.


What about bringing some sort of cryptocurrency (testnet/stagenet) into the project? 
Use stagenets to indicate it's monopoly money effectively. 

How complex does my Problem to be Solved need to be? Should it be like an Abstract?
